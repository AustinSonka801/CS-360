Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app was meant for tracking inventory, featuring Login, View inventory, and Enter inventory sceens. Users could set personal inventory goals.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
I created three main screens to fulfill user needs: login, daily inventory display, and inventory entry. The login screen enables account login or creation. The daily inventory screen shows a grid of entered inventory for each day. The weight entry screen has a simple input box and save button for adding or editing inventory. The minimalistic design ensures ease of use and understanding.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
In coding my app, I heavily leaned on the knowledge from the course's ZyBooks material. It taught me essential skills in using Android Studio, such as creating accessible buttons, setting up a database, and navigating between screens in the app. These skills are valuable and can be applied to future Android Studio projects I undertake.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Testing your code using the Android Studio debugger was a smart move. Ensuring the proper behavior of each function is crucial for user safety and security. For instance, during initial tests, I discovered a flaw in a comparison within my functions that consistently returned true, highlighting the importance of thorough testing for reliability and security.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
The Android Studio layout editor pushed me to think creatively while crafting each layout for my application. It's one thing to understand the components and their connections, but using the editor demanded a different level of creativity and practical application of that knowledge.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The UI was were i was most successful as i had prior work experience.
